# README

This repository serves as a backup to scripts and datasets for posts I write on [my personal site](http://www.timtrice.co). All scripts, unless otherwise mentioned, fall under the MIT license. Dataset licenses will be listed in the respective directory.

## Who Am I?

I have worked +ten years in the information management field for the oil industry in Houston, Texas. I started learning programming with PHP and MySQL just over ten years ago. Over time that has crossed over into learning R and, recently, Python. 

I am not a data scientist. I want to be a data scientist. I do not have a college degree. I am considering returning to school at least to get my Bachelor's. Everything you see on the site is self-taught. From coding to understanding data structure to linear algebra. I make every effort to ensure:

1. All data goes through QA/QC. 

1. All code is as simplified as possible. However, I may have written something previously and discovered a better way to write it. I will update as much as I can as soon as I can. However, if you notice any issues, please let me know by posting an issue.

1. All code is reproducible. 

1. All datasets, when possible, are publicly available *somewhere*.

## My Current Projects

### [Hurricanes](https://github.com/timtrice/hurricanes)

This is a project I've always worked on when learning programming but over time have lost the code. About 13 years ago, my first programming experience was writing a hurricane tracking program. I have always had a huge fascination with hurricanes. The program eventually moved online before fading. 

However, this project has always been my platform for learning coding and databases. 

### [NCDC Storm Events](https://github.com/timtrice/NCDC-Storm-Events)

This is a new project I just began recently. I'm still in the process of cleaning up and doing exploratory.
