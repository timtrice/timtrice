Tim Trice is an information manager, data analyst and data engineer with over ten years experience in the energy industry. In that time, he has worked on upstream and downstream projects for companies such as Wood Group Mustang, Chevron Corp, BP US and Shell Petroleum.

When he is not wrangling data, he is practicing guitar, building models, flying drones, running with his two pit bulls, or embarassing his son in Madden NFL. Only one of the previous statements is untrue.
