## Two-Variable Linear Equations

### Standard form for linear equations

Point-slope form

If line has a slop $m$ and $x = a$ and $y = b$

$$(y-b) = m(x-a)$$

Standard form

$$Ax + By = C$$

Where $A$, $B$ and $C$ are real numbers.

$$9x + 16y = 72$$

With standard form we can find the y-intercept *and* x-intercept.

x    | y
:---:|:---:
 n   |  0
 0   |  n

So, how do we find $n$ for both $x$ and $y$? 

First, for $x$:
$$9x + 16y = 72$$
$$(9)(0) + 16y = 72$$
$$16y = 72$$
$$y = \frac{72}{16}$$
$$y = 4.5$$

x    | y
:---:|:---:
 n   |  0
 0   |  45

And, for $y$:
$$9x + 16y = 72$$
$$9x + (16)(0) = 72$$
$$9x = 72$$
$$x = \frac{72}{9}$$
$$x = 8$$

x    | y
:---:|:---:
 8   |  0
 0   |  45
