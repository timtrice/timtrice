## Super Bowl Quarterbacks

As a Houston Texans fan, the big talk this offseason has been drafting a quarterback. Inevitably, that discussion seems to tilt towards finding winning quarterbacks in late rounds, a la Tom Brady. 

I wanted to get a look at Super Bowl quarterbacks and where they were drafted. I'm using two data sets I've obtained from [Pro-Football-Reference.com](http://www.sports-reference.com/data_use.shtml).
