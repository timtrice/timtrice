## Super Bowl Quarterbacks

I have two datasets that I parsed from [Pro-Football-Reference.com](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/). The first is of starting quarterbacks in a Super Bowl. The second is of all quarterback drafts since 1937. 

Here is a list of Super Bowl starting quarterbacks:

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
print(xtable(sbqb[, .(Name, 
                      Record = paste(AdjWins, "-", AdjLosses))][]), 
      type = "html", 
      include.rownames = FALSE)
```


```{r}
sbqb <- merge(dqb, sbqb, by="Name")
```
