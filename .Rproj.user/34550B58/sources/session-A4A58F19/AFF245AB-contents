I am an information management professional with an extensive technical background honed by experience as a
document control specialist and data analyst. As I am highly skilled in transforming data into readable reports to
facilitate enterprise planning and reporting, decision-making, and growth, I have ensured the highest data quality for
numerous large capital projects ($10B+) for clients like Chevron, BP, Shell, ExxonMobil, and more.

Key strengths include:
 * 15+ years of programming experience (HTML, PHP, SQL, Excel/Access, Python, and R).
 * The ability to develop, establish, and manage efficient project workflows to reduce errors, maximize resources,
and minimize costs.
 * Team awareness, leadership, and collaboration.
 * Exemplary capacity to gather, understand, and drive project resolutions from a cross-functional team.
 * High intellectual and emotional intelligence with excellent analytical, strategic, business judgement, and
problem-solving abilities.
 * Communication, prioritization, organization, and time management skills.

Throughout my career, I have conducted data analytics to monitor, analyze, and synthesize countless reports, timelines,
trends, and interdependencies to influence short and long-term planning. An employee who leads by example, I possess
the agility and flexibility to thrive in fast-paced, deadline driven environments. Not only do I change and generate
processes for greater effectiveness and efficiency, I leverage a team-oriented mindset to align my vision, mission, and
strategy with a company’s overarching objectives.
