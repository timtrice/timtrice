      <description>Hurricane Harvey Barometric Pressure Wind Rain Tornadoes  Code Libraries Data  Previous Versions Session Info   On August 26, 2017, Hurricane Harvey made landfall along the central Texas gulf coast as a category four hurricane. The storm weakened but remained stationary in southeast Texas spawing dozens of tornadoes and dropping over 30 inches of rain in many locations with isolated amounts of over 50 inches.
Harvey was the first major hurricane to strike the Texas coast since Hurricane Rita in 2005; the first category four hurricane to make landfall since Hurricane Bret in 1999.</description>

      <title>Top Tornadic Tropical Cyclones</title>

      <description>With Hurricane Harvey seemingly producing numerous tornadoes (many unconfirmed touchdowns) I wanted to get a view of the top tornadic-producing tropical cyclones.
History of tropical cyclone-spawned tornadoes lists the “Tropical cyclone tornado data set” (xls) as a source. However, this dataset does not include anything post-2015. I am unable to find an updated dataset.
As of this writing, officially Harvey has only produced two tornadoes. But, as a resident of the greater Houston area I can tell you the warnings are flying!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m proud to introduce two new packages for the R community: HURDAT and rrricanes.
Both packages are complimentary to one another.
HURDAT is a dataset of tropical cyclones that have developed in the Atlantic and northeast Pacific oceans since 1851 and 1949, respectively. HURDAT is a re-analysis project as conducated by the Hurricane Research Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. They review known data to determine the best track, intensity and structure of a cyclone.</description>

      <description>Installation Included Datasets Atlantic (AL) Northeast Pacific (EP)  Variables Data Quality   HURDAT is a R package based off the Hurricane Re-Analysis Project by the Hurricane Research Division. The package contains two datasets; one for Atlantic Ocean cyclones and one for northeastern Pacific cyclones.
Installation HURDAT requires R version 3.4.0 or greater.
install.packages(&amp;quot;HURDAT&amp;quot;) library(HURDAT) # Additional libraries used for this document library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) library(Hmisc) library(knitr) library(purrr) library(readr)  Included Datasets The raw dataset is updated annually; typically during late winter or spring.</description>

      <description>What is rrricanes Installing rrricanes About the Data Getting Data Basic Data Track Wind and Gust Pressure Seas  Wind Radius Hurricane Ike Wind Radius  Forecast Positions Forecast Wind Radius Future Plans Issues   To go along with my HURDAT package I’m releasing rrricanes, version 0.1.0. This library is not in cran and will not be submitted until release 0.2.0.
What is rrricanes I’ve had a fascination with hurricanes since I was a very little kid.</description>
