      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m proud to introduce two new packages for the R community: HURDAT and rrricanes.
Both packages are complimentary to one another.
HURDAT is a dataset of tropical cyclones that have developed in the Atlantic and northeast Pacific oceans since 1851 and 1949, respectively. HURDAT is a re-analysis project as conducated by the Hurricane Research Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. They review known data to determine the best track, intensity and structure of a cyclone.</description>
