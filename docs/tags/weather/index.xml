      <description>With Hurricane Harvey seemingly producing numerous tornadoes (many unconfirmed touchdowns) I wanted to get a view of the top tornadic-producing tropical cyclones.
History of tropical cyclone-spawned tornadoes lists the “Tropical cyclone tornado data set” (xls) as a source. However, this dataset does not include anything post-2015. I am unable to find an updated dataset.
As of this writing, officially Harvey has only produced two tornadoes. But, as a resident of the greater Houston area I can tell you the warnings are flying!</description>
