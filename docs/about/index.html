    <p>I have a huge love of data and finding better solutions to known and unknown issues. For example, when I learned a team was manually entering information into their software, I developed a way to make it point-and-click saving several hours worth of work per week.</p>

<p>I began programming shortly after my son&rsquo;s birth in 2003. I had already been somewhat exposed to MS Access when a company I worked for needed me to help clean their vendor data registers. This helped expose me to some VBA and SQL.</p>

<p>Shortly after I bought my first laptop and began writing a hurricane tracking program. After all, what better way to learn to do something than to apply it to what you know.</p>

<p>I quickly learned pattern matching, creating maps and scheduling scripts to keep the program up-to-date. At one point, Personal Hurricane Center was one of the top-selling hurricane tracking programs available.</p>

<p>Soon after I moved it online and made the information free. This meant learning PHP and MySQL and, at some point, the CakePHP framework. I developed other projects as well; web scrapers, custom WordPress-like blogs, HTML, etc. But, none of it kept my interest. Eventually I let all of the projects disappear or handed them off to whoever wanted them.</p>

<p>In 2009 I began trading the stock market finding cheap stocks looking for some returns and moving onto the next. It took a couple of years before someone had pointed me in the direction of not only analyzing the results; i.e., the data, but using what I knew to examine potentially new opportunities.</p>

<p>In essence, data science.</p>

<p>I am not a data scientist; I do not have a college degree. I do consider myself a data enthusiast. I have seen firsthand how data clarity can lead to better decisions in all aspects of life. And my hope with this site is to help others who are on a similar path.</p>
