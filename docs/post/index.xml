      <description>Hurricane Harvey Barometric Pressure Wind Rain Tornadoes  Code Libraries Data  Previous Versions Session Info   On August 26, 2017, Hurricane Harvey made landfall along the central Texas gulf coast as a category four hurricane. The storm weakened but remained stationary in southeast Texas spawing dozens of tornadoes and dropping over 30 inches of rain in many locations with isolated amounts of over 50 inches.
Harvey was the first major hurricane to strike the Texas coast since Hurricane Rita in 2005; the first category four hurricane to make landfall since Hurricane Bret in 1999.</description>

      <description>A question was posted earlier wondering the longest time a cyclone had spent over land. Using HURDAT we can calculate this.

Using the rnaturalearthdata package in conjunction with HURDAT::AL, we identify Lat/Lon points within AL that are within the map_units50 polygon shapefile.</description>

      <title>Top Tornadic Tropical Cyclones</title>

      <description>With Hurricane Harvey seemingly producing numerous tornadoes (many unconfirmed touchdowns) I wanted to get a view of the top tornadic-producing tropical cyclones.
History of tropical cyclone-spawned tornadoes lists the “Tropical cyclone tornado data set” (xls) as a source. However, this dataset does not include anything post-2015. I am unable to find an updated dataset.
As of this writing, officially Harvey has only produced two tornadoes. But, as a resident of the greater Houston area I can tell you the warnings are flying!</description>

      <title>Introducing rrricanes, HURDAT</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m proud to introduce two new packages for the R community: HURDAT and rrricanes.
Both packages are complimentary to one another.
HURDAT is a dataset of tropical cyclones that have developed in the Atlantic and northeast Pacific oceans since 1851 and 1949, respectively. HURDAT is a re-analysis project as conducated by the Hurricane Research Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. They review known data to determine the best track, intensity and structure of a cyclone.</description>
