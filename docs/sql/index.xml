      <description>Using employees database, we need to find the highest-paid employee in our database.
With this particular database we have to be careful about making assumptions of our data, some of which would be:
 Only one salary record per employee
 All salary records are current
 Maximum salary is the current salary
  If our salaries table only consists of current employees and current salary information, then we can do a simple SELECT MAX query and be done.</description>
