      <description>I have a huge love of data and finding better solutions to known and unknown issues. For example, when I learned a team was manually entering information into their software, I developed a way to make it point-and-click saving several hours worth of work per week.
I began programming shortly after my son&amp;rsquo;s birth in 2003. I had already been somewhat exposed to MS Access when a company I worked for needed me to help clean their vendor data registers.</description>

      <description> R  HURDAT is a dataset from the Hurricane Re-Analysis project. It contains storm data for hundreds of cyclones for storms that have developed in the northwestern hemisphere (Atlantic and Pacific) since 1851.
 rrricanes is a more comprehensive dataset of Atlantic and Pacific cyclones but only those since 1998. It gives access to as-issued text products for past and current cyclones including forecast and structure data.
